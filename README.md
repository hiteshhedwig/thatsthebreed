They do incredible job in model deployment. Somehow, its outdated and doesn't work for fastai2. So i have created by version of webapp on the top of their ideas.
If you succesfully able to deploy your webapp. Do remember to cite the original creators. They did the most of hardwork. We should be humbled.
Thanks :)
